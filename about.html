He is focused to growing the business by fostering a culture of operational efficiency, and inspiring company associates to continue to deliver forward-thinking solutions. He is a grade 12 student in the regional program at Gordon Graydon Memorial Secondary School. Moaaz has held many leadership positions throughout his past years with DECA, IBT & GDM Council, Media Lab, and Mississauga City Youth Council. E+3 is a start up which has the goal of being recognized by their customers for their products, the care they deliver it with, and the emotional investment which they input throughout the entire process. E+3 is almost committed to giving back -- as a company and as individuals. Personally, that's through serving on the Mississauga East-Cooksville Constituency Youth Council, and WE Club.
              Moaaz believes in the values of teamwork, ingenuity, dedication, and commitment through passion to excellence. He strives to create an environment based on these values at E+3.">

I'm Michelle Pham, currently studying at John Cabot Secondary School. As VP of Production I try to find the best means, from materials to sourcing, to translate our company's vision into the best product possible. To me, there's a beauty in turning a blueprint into a reality. At my school, I've gotten to work with different suppliers to produce customized spiritwear for many clubs and teams. Outside of E+3 I love to volunteer, especially working with others. One of my favourite places to volunteer is at my church's Children's Liturgies. I love working with the children and helping to prepare the learning materials for the kids. There, we try to make learning as exciting as possible for the children, which is why I'm proud to be a member of the E+3 team. Alongside E+3 I aspire to help create a quality means for kids to learn in the most enjoyable way possible.">

I'm Adrian Ho, the VP of Finance of E+3, studying in Applewood Heights Secondary School. Talking about finance, you'll think about money matter, and talking about E+3, you'll think about kids. To be honest, I enjoy dealing with both. I like handling money because I do great both in the school's accounting courses and in DECA; I like being with kids because … I just like kids! I even volunteer as a Scouter so that I can give my best to them! With my passion and ability, I lead the company's finance department that consists of myself and three other reliable teammates. You might not see us too often because we're the behind-the-scenes people who take care of matters like budgeting, transactions, bank account, etc. Yet, even so, we still have the same overall objective as the everyone else in E+3 — to educate kids in the most entertaining way.">

Essentially, that is the main reason why I decided to join this team, my love for business must be fulfilled! My main role consists of managing people at the business. I also ensure everyone's well-being and satisfaction. This is no problem for me since I love working with people. I also love working with children! I am so pleased to work with such a kid-friendly company. From my volunteer experience at community centres and daycares, I have learned that kids enjoy playing games as this helps them learn best. That is why my team and I decided to create this company. As my position in Human Resources, I strongly believe that E + 3 can not only make a change in children's lives, but their parents as well. There is no better way to educate your kid than to bond with them through their passion for entertainment!">

Technology is the reason why I volunteer at Robotics tournaments, but not only that, I also enjoy helping and working with the youth of tomorrow, which is why I'm an executive of WeDay! My love and technological outlook allowed me to lead a group of three others and be an effect technology team here at E+3.
